# dotfiles
## Purpose

Anytime I migrate my data, I invariably forget to copy over personal config files. Well, never again! This time I will make a GitHub repository with my dotfiles, and then symlink them to their locations. As a result, they will be backed up as well as version controlled and documented in case of any issues.
